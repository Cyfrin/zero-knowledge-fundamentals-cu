Welcome to the repository for the Zero-Knowledge Fundamentals Course. This course is a high-level introduction to zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs): what they are and why they are really cool! 

This course will help you go from having no idea what ZKPs to being able to understand what they are conceptually. It is intended as a preliminary resource for both devs and non-devs prior to learning any math or practical coding.

- [The ZK Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6GT105Xm2rJzntZjTrSRwC?si=TjYOcAs-TwmNQGtdjODusw) also has some awesome examples (including the wheere's Waldo example where I first heard it).
- [Jarrod Watts](https://x.com/jarrodWattsDev) explains some examples in [his video on zero-knowledge proofs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MYpZQVZdiM)!

## ZK terminology

_[⌨️ ZK terminology](https://updraft.cyfrin.io/courses/fundamentals-of-zero-knowledge-proofs/fundamentals/zk-terminology)_

Helpful resource that helped research for this video:
- [Article by Santiago Palladino A beginner's intro to coding zero-knowledge proofs](https://dev.to/spalladino/a-beginners-intro-to-coding-zero-knowledge-proofs-c56)
- [This QAPs article by Vitalik Buterin explains the witness well in context](https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/quadratic-arithmetic-programs-from-zero-to-hero-f6d558cea649)

## The trusted setup

- Big thanks to Vitalik Buterin for [his blog post on the trusted setup](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2022/03/14/trustedsetup.html#:~:text=Many%20cryptographic%20protocols%2C%20especially%20in,some%20cryptographic%20protocol%20is%20run.). This video was researched using this awesome article.

## Proof of computation

_[⌨️ Proof of computation](https://updraft.cyfrin.io/courses/fundamentals-of-zero-knowledge-proofs/fundamentals/proof-of-computation)_

Quote from the [Noir](https://noir-lang.org/) website that makes things clearer:

-  "Noir is a language for private and verifiable computing. It enables creating succinct proofs of successful program execution. "

- [Vitalik's article on SNARKs for proof of computation](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2021/01/26/snarks.html)

# Disclosures

Transparency is important! So we want to disclose any potential conflicts that might have affected my judgement so you can pick tools that are right for you. Patrick is co-founder of Alpha Chain, a blockchain infrastructure company. Alpha Chain runs **Chainlink, Ethereum, Binance, Polygon, Harmony, Solana, Moonbeam, and Moonriver blockchain services.** Alpha Chain often works with Alchemy and receives discounted services. Patrick is the co-founder of Cyfrin, and they do smart contract security & auditing services. Patrick is also the co-founder of Chain Accel, who is an advisor on the Peeranha project.

Because of all this, I have added alternatives to each section where we suggest a tool.
